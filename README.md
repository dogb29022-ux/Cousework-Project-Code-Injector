# Project Code Injector
Python based code injector tool which can inject payload inside any files.

## Introduction
This project is focused on how code injection works at conceptual and practical level. The main aim is educational purpose to explore how injectors operate,the reason to call them a security risk and how this techiniques are in  controlled enviroment like research, testing, and in learning scenarios.

overall this project replicates a hands-on learning exprience in low-level security concepts and demonstrates how theory connects with real-worls system behavior.
